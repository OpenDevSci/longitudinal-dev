## About the Project

This repository is intended to serve as an open-source hub designed to foster collaboration, learning, and application of longitudinal data science. This project, underpinned by data from the ABCD Study¬Æ, aims to bridge the gap between statistical methods and their practical implementation. A primary aim is to enable researchers and students alike to access, contribute to, and learn from a rich repository of knowledge and code.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Method Overviews**: Detailed explanations and comparisons of various longitudinal analysis methods.
- **R Code Snippets**: Ready-to-use code examples to help researchers apply methods to their own data.
- **Collaborative Environment**: Tools and guidelines for contributing to both the academic manuscript and codebase.
- **Educational Resources**: Guides, tutorials, and links to further readings for those new to longitudinal analysis.

## Getting Started
