## Getting Started 🚀

If you’re new to **longitudinal.dev**, start by checking out the [project README](README.md) for a quick overview. The README covers our goals and mission, providing a helpful foundation for understanding how you can contribute.

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you’re familiar with:

- Basic [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com) usage
- [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) (our collaborative workflow)
- [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for writing and editing documentation

### Internal Members

For contributors who are members of the repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beginDevSci/longitudinal-dev.git
   cd longitudinal-dev
   ```

2.	Create a Branch: Create a branch for your work. Use a descriptive name (e.g., feature-login-ui or fix-typo-docs).

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

3.	Make Your Changes: After making changes, commit them with a clear message.

4.	Push and Open a PR: Push your branch to GitHub and open a Pull Request (PR). Give it a meaningful title and provide a brief description of your changes.
   
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
After pushing, go to the repository on GitHub and open a PR. Mention relevant team members if needed.

External Contributors

If you’re new to the repository, welcome! Follow these steps to contribute:

1.	Fork the Repository: In the top right of the main repository page, click Fork to create a personal copy of the repo on your GitHub account.

2.	Clone Your Fork: Download the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/longitudinal-dev.git
   cd longitudinal-dev
   ```

3.	Create a Branch, Make Changes, and Open a PR: Follow the same branching, committing, and PR steps as internal members. We’ll review your PR and provide feedback if necessary.

Understanding GitHub Flow 🔄

We follow GitHub Flow to maintain a smooth workflow and ensure project stability. Here’s an overview:

	1.	Create a Branch for each new feature or fix.
	2.	Commit Regularly with clear messages describing your changes.
	3.	Open a PR when you’re ready for feedback or merging.
	4.	Review and Discuss your PR. Other contributors may provide feedback to improve your code.
	5.	Merge Approved Changes to the main branch, which triggers deployment.

This process helps keep the codebase organized and reliable for everyone. For more details, refer to our GitHub Flow Guide.

Contribution Guidelines 📝

Here are a few things to keep in mind when contributing:

Code Contributions

	•	Coding Standards: Follow the project’s coding style and conventions. We recommend using Prettier for code formatting.
	•	Testing: Ensure that your changes don’t break existing functionality. Add tests if applicable.
	•	Commit Messages: Use clear and descriptive commit messages. Think of commit messages as a record of what each change accomplishes.

Documentation Contributions

	•	Improving Documentation: If you notice any typos, unclear sections, or areas that could be expanded, feel free to make edits.
	•	Writing Style: Aim for clear, concise language. Follow Markdown best practices.

Tutorials and Examples

Our tutorials cover a range of topics in longitudinal data analysis. You can contribute by:

	•	Adding New Tutorials: Cover topics like linear mixed-effects models, growth curve models, or survival analysis.
	•	Improving Existing Tutorials: Edit for clarity, update examples, or correct errors.
	•	Providing Sample Datasets: Include simple, generated datasets when possible to make tutorials more accessible.

Issue Reporting

Found a bug or have an idea for a new feature? We’d love to hear it!

	•	Search Existing Issues: Before opening a new issue, check if it’s already reported.
	•	Use Issue Templates: Select the appropriate template for bugs, feature requests, or general questions.
	•	Provide Details: Include as much information as possible (steps to reproduce, screenshots, etc.).

GitHub Projects 🗂

Our GitHub Projects board tracks ongoing tasks and project progress. Take a look to see if there’s an open issue or task that matches your skills and interests.

GitHub Codespaces ☁️

GitHub Codespaces offers a fully managed, cloud-based development environment:

	1.	Create a Codespace: Open the repository on GitHub and select “Code” > “Codespaces” > “Create codespace on main.”
	2.	For more details, check our Codespaces Setup Guide.

This option can save time by avoiding local setup!
