## Getting Started 🚀

Please start by reviewing our [project's README](README.md) for an overview of longitudinal.dev, which sets the foundation for meaningful contributions.

### Prerequisites

- **Git**: Ensure you have Git installed on your machine.
- **Node.js and npm**: Install the latest LTS version of Node.js, which includes npm.
- **Familiarity with Nuxt.js and Vue.js**: Our project is built with Nuxt.js and Vue.js.

### Internal Members

Repository members should:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beginDevSci/longitudinal-dev.git
   cd longitudinal-dev
   ```

2.	Create a New Branch
Create a new branch to keep your changes organized and separate from the main branch. Replace branch-name with a descriptive name for your branch.

   ```bash
git checkout -b branch-name
```

	3.	Push Changes to GitHub
After committing your changes to the new branch, push it to the repository.
   
   ```bash
   git push origin branch-name
   ```

  4.	Open a Pull Request (PR)
On GitHub, go to the repository page and open a pull request to propose your changes. Provide a clear title and description and tag any collaborators if needed.

External Contributors

If you are not a repository member:

	1.	Fork the Repository
Go to the longitudinal.dev repository on GitHub and click “Fork” in the top right corner.
	2.	Clone Your Fork 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/longitudinal-dev.git
cd longitudinal-dev
   ```

   3.	Create a New Branch

   	3.	Create a Branch, Make Changes, and Open a PR
Follow the same steps as internal members to create a branch, push changes, and open a pull request.

Local Development Setup

After cloning, set up your environment:

	1.	Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   2.	Start the Development Server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
This will start the Nuxt.js development server. You can view the project at http://localhost:3000.

For detailed setup instructions, refer to our Codespaces Setup Guide or use a prebuilt GitHub Codespace (recommended).

Understanding GitHub Flow 🔄

Our GitHub Flow workflow helps organize contributions and ensure reliable deployments:

	1.	Create a branch for each feature or fix.
	2.	Commit changes with clear messages.
	3.	Open a Pull Request (PR) to propose changes.
	4.	Review and discuss PRs for code quality and feedback.
	5.	Merge approved changes into main for deployment.

This workflow applies to all contributors and keeps the project stable and organized. For further details, see our GitHub Flow Guide.
